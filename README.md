This is Lab 5: XML & .NET using MVC for course 
HTTP-5203 XML and Web Services

Tasks completed
- Create a controller for books.
- Create a model for Book with just the id, title, firstname, middlename, lastname as properties. You can include authortitle as well to get practice adding an attribute (useful for Assignment 2).
- Create a Create action with and create a View using the "Create" template and linking it to the model class. This will generate most of the form in the view for you.
- Complete the add logic (the load XML/add/save logic in the Create() action in the module example is pretty much the same).
- Auto incrementing ID
- Added attribute too.

1 addional thing that I tried doing  that is still left is to show author title in table.
